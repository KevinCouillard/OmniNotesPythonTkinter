**Omni-Notes Python**
=================
What is this?
=================

This is a conversion of Omni-Notes java version to python. It was created with the use `Tkinter`_, a GUI toolkit, as well as `Pillow`_, a Python Imaging Library (PIL).

How to run this project?
=================

To run this project you need to install Python, perferrably 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8. You will also need to install Tkinter and Pillow.   

Documentation
================

Currently no documentation for this project.

Access `Tkinter Documentation`_.

Current State
================

The current state is very incomplete:

\- Only the text note option works, yet adding multiple notes does not

\- The canvas note option is full of errors that need addressing

\- The list note implementation is missing

\- The sidebar is currently only on the main window

\- Each screen opens a new window (maybe should clear and replace previous)

\- Toolbar frontend incomplete w/ no backend

Future State
================

For the future I hope to see the canvas note fully implemented, as well as the rest for that matter.
I also hope to complete the toolbar implementation.
Apart from these, in general I hope to continue modeling this app after the original, Java, OmniNotes. 
I understand that there is limitations through using Python and this was merely for me to learn Python, so I am not hoping for too much out of this project in the future.
